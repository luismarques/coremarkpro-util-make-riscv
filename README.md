# coremarkpro-util-make-riscv

This repository provides the utility files to port CoreMark-Pro to RISC-V.

**Purpose**

 Port RISC-V (RV64G) to CoreMark-Pro.
 
**Requirements**

  - You must have your own copy of EEMBC's [CoreMark-Pro](https://www.eembc.org/coremark-pro/faq.php).
  - You must have installed the RISC-V tools (preferably, the Linux-ELF/glibc toolchain).

**Setup**

  - Download and unpack CoreMark-Pro from [EEMBC's website](http://www.google.com/search?q=coremark+pro+github)
  - Copy `riscv64.mak` and `riscv-gcc64.mak` files into the `coremarkpro_1.1.2743/util/make` directory.

**Building Binaries**

    make TARGET=riscv64

**Running Binaries on Spike**

    make TARGET=riscv64 certify-all
    
By default, the `*.mak` files set `RUN` to use `spike pk`. Change `RUN` to suit your needs.

**Making a Portable Directory**

If you would like to compile CMP and then move the binaries to an other platform (say, an FPGA), you can find the binaries in:

> coremarkpro_1.1.2743/builds/riscv64/riscv-gcc64/bin

Move this directory as desired.

**Invoking Binaries Manually**

Move to your directory of CMP binaries and set `RUN` as desired:

    $RUN ./cjpeg-rose7-preset.riscv -c1 -v0 -i100
    $RUN ./core.riscv -h -c1 -v0
    $RUN ./linear_alg-mid-100x100-sp.riscv -c1 -v0
    $RUN ./loops-all-mid-10k-sp.riscv -c1 -v0 -i20
    $RUN ./nnet_test.riscv -c1 -v0
    $RUN ./parser-125k.riscv -c1 -v0 -i50
    $RUN ./radix2-big-64k.riscv -c1 -v0
    $RUN ./sha-test.riscv -c1 -v0 -i75
    $RUN ./zip-test.riscv -c1 -v0
    
 `-c1` is single-core, `-v0` is verification turned off (vs. `-v1`), and `-i` is iteration count. 
 
 **Getting a CMP Score**
 
 If you are manually running CMP on a separate platform -- and not invoking it from the CMP build system -- you will not get a valid CMP score. Nonetheless, here is a hacky, terrible, lying script you can use to get a feel for your CMP performance. DO NOT REPORT THIS SCORE.
 
 Place the output from each of your experiments in `${DIR}/${b}.out` where `${b}` is the name of the CMP benchmark as described from within `get-coremarkpro-score.sh`.
  
 Modify this script as necessary to point to your CMP installation and then run it:
 
     ./get-coremarkpro-score.sh
